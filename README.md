[LX Studio](http://lx.studio/) is a digital lighting workstation, bringing concepts from digital audio workstations and modular synthesis into the realm of LED lighting control. Generative patterns, interactive inputs, and flexible parameter-driven modulation — a rich environment for lighting composition and performance.

### Getting Started ###

LX Studio runs on top of Processing. [Download and install Processing &rarr;](https://processing.org/download/)

Next, clone this project and open the LXStudio.pde project in Processing:
```
$ cd ~/Documents/Processing
$ git clone https://github.com/heronarts/LXStudio.git
```

Consult the [LX Studio API reference &rarr;](http://lx.studio/api/)

More and better documentation is coming soon!
