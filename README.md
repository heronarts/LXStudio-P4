LX Studio has been superceded by the [Chromatik](https://chromatik.co/) Digital Lighting Workstation, which uses the same underlying [LX](https://github.com/heronarts/LX) libraries with a new, modern UI layer. [Chromatik](https://chromatik.co/) continues in the tradition of LX Studio as an open and extensible framework for custom development. It is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. More information can be found on the website.

![LX Studio](https://raw.github.com/heronarts/LXStudio/master/assets/screenshot.jpg)

[LX Studio](http://lx.studio/) is a digital lighting workstation, bringing concepts from digital audio workstations and modular synthesis into the realm of LED lighting control. Generative patterns, interactive inputs, and flexible parameter-driven modulation â€” a rich environment for lighting composition and performance.

### Getting Started ###

LX Studio runs on top of Processing 4. [Download and install Processing 4 &rarr;](https://processing.org/download/)

```
$ cd ~/Documents/Processing

```

Or via direct download: https://github.com/heronarts/LXStudio-P4/archive/master.zip

Next, open the LXStudio.pde project in Processing 4 and click Run.

Documentation is available on the [LX Studio Wiki &rarr;](https://github.com/heronarts/LXStudio/wiki)
